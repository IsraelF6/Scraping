     Scraping
==================

Made By: Israel Felhandler

This program made for a Python class will navigate to the FSU CS department website and print out a directory containing the telephone number, office location,
email, and webpage of every faculty member in the department. The script uses the root page for faculty listings at http://www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/ and dynamically gathers the information from each faculty member's website.

## Sample output

$ python faculty_directory.py
